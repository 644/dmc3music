### How to setup
First, [click here to download](https://github.com/644/dmc3music/releases/download/v1.6/dmc3music.zip)

Then unzip, and start the game. It should play automatically.

It should play the correct tracks in every room, aside from a few places that will be fixed in a later release. If any rooms are missing, please let me know which by filing an issue here, or messaging me (hies) on the [dmc3 discord](https://discord.gg/yhJdCHm). It also fades out tracks when all enemies are killed, remembers a tracks play position across rooms (can customize for how long), has a volume slider, and an option to shuffle the songs instead of playing the correct ones.

Make sure to disable the sound driver in style switcher otherwise you'll have multiple tracks playing.

I plan to add more features in the future, like customizing tracks for each room/mission, and adding your own tracks.
