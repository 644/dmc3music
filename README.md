### How to setup
First, [click here to download](https://github.com/644/dmc3music/releases/download/v1.4/dmc3music.zip)

Then unzip, start the game and click the play button.

It will play the correct tracks for most rooms, only rooms that are reused later in the game play the later song's version, but that can be fixed in a later release by using the mission number. It also fades out tracks when all enemies are killed, remembers a tracks play position across rooms, has a volume slider, and an option to shuffle the songs instead of playing the correct ones.

Make sure to disable the sound driver in style switcher otherwise you'll have multiple tracks playing.

I plan to add more features in the future, like customizing tracks for each room/mission, adding your own tracks, and selecting the correct tracks for each room.
