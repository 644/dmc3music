# DMC3 Music
### How to setup
First, [click here to download](https://github.com/644/dmc3music/releases/download/v1.0/dmc3music.zip)

Then unzip, start the game and click "play music".

It should automatically play random battle themes when you encounter enemies, and the correct boss battle themes for each boss (some may be wrong).

Make sure to disable the sound driver in style switcher otherwise you'll have multiple tracks playing.

I plan to add more features in the future, like customizing tracks for each room/mission, adding your own tracks, and selecting the correct tracks for each room.
