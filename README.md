# DMC3 Tools
Quick usage: https://youtu.be/of25whTptZQ

### How to setup
First, [click here to download](https://github.com/644/dmc3music/releases/download/v2.0/dmc3tools.zip)

Then unzip, start dmc3tools.exe and start the game. It should play music automatically.

You can install and configure StyleSwitcher (only 3.1.3 right now) and your controller using this as well. Just click the "options" tab, set the path to the root folder of your DMC3 installation, then click the "Style Switcher" button, configure to your liking and then "install". For the controller config, if the L2/R2 buttons aren't being detected, just set "This is an Xbox controller", then fill out the rest of the buttons by clicking them and pressing the button on your controller and it should work.

It should play the correct tracks in every room, aside from a few places that will be fixed in a later release. If any rooms are missing, please let me know which by filing an issue here, or messaging me (hies) on the [dmc3 discord](https://discord.gg/yhJdCHm). It also fades out tracks when all enemies are killed, remembers a tracks play position across rooms (can customize for how long), has a volume slider, and an option to shuffle the songs instead of playing the correct ones.

Make sure to disable the sound driver in style switcher otherwise you'll have multiple tracks playing.

I plan to add more features in the future, like customizing tracks for each room/mission, and adding your own tracks.
